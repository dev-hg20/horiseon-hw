# 01 Refractor Project - Horiseon

## Description

Horiseon requested for a codebase that follows accessibility standards in order for it's site to be optimised by search engines. In order to do so, the source code has been refracted to have semantic HTML element structure. It's elements also follow a logical structure. Alt attributes for images have also been included and heading attributes now fall in sequential order.

Comments have also been included to ensure the client and future developersare clear on each section of this project.

Refracting this code made both its' HTML and stylesheet more concise. Through this project, I learnt the basic of html and css as well as it's implementation. It was a fun task to clean up the code and apply what I have learnt in class, it gave me the opportunity to put theory into practice. I took the liberty to fix a few broken anchor links within the site as well as an action for each navigation to make it clearer when you hover over each product.
